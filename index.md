The Intelligent Visualization lab was created in the fall of 2019, when [Dr. Enamul Hoque Prince](https://www.yorku.ca/enamulh/index.html) joined the School of Information Technology at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca). He is a member of the Graduate Faculty for both the Department of [Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/) and the [School of Information Technology](http://itec.laps.yorku.ca/). Before joining York University Dr. Enamul Hoque Prince was a postdoc in the HCI group at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where he worked with [Maneesh Agrawala](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/). 

The lab's research focuses on combining information visualization and human-computer interaction with natural language processing to address the challenges of the information overload problem. More specifically, I focus on devising novel visual analytics techniques to explore large datasets such as online conversations as well as understanding the utility and potential trade-offs of such techniques from the real userâ€™s perspectives.

## Prospective Students

We are looking for qualified students for positions in my research group, including MSc and PhD students in [Computer Science](http://eecs.gradstudies.yorku.ca/future-students/), and Master of [Information Systems & Technology students](https://ist.gradstudies.yorku.ca/). Please drop me an email with your CV if you are interested in pursuing research in any of the areas of natural language processing, information visualization and HCI.

## Recent Projects


## _Natural Language Interactions with Visual Analytics_

{% include figure.html image="images/deictic.png" link="/research/" search="Natural Language" %}

This project explores how principles from language pragmatics can be applied
to the flow of visual analytical conversations, using natural language as an input modality.


## _Visual text analytics for online conversations_

{% include figure.html image="images/3.jpg" link="/research/" search="Visual Text" %}

We developed visual text analytics tools and techniques for exploring and analyzing online conversations.

## _User-Adaptive Information Visualization_

{% include figure.html image="images/intervention2.png" link="/research/" search="User" %}

This project explores how user characteristics impacts on visualization effectiveness and how can a visualization adapt to such characterstics.

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Technology at York University. I am a member of the Graduate Faculty for both the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and the School of Information Technology. Before joining York University I was a postdoc in the HCI group at Stanford University, where I worked with Maneesh Agrawala.
